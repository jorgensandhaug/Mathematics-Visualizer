# Overview 

## About
The project was created by JÃ¸rgen Sandhaug and Halvor Linder to compute and visualize mathematical expressions and objects. 
It is programmed in Java and build using Maven. JavaFX is used for graphical elements.
## Structure 
The application consists of three windows:  
- The input window
- The 2D graphics window
- The 3D graphics window
The input window is used for defining variables and functions, while the 2D and 3D graphics windows are used for displaying these.

A user manual can be found [here](USER_MANUAL.md)


# List of features
### Variable manipulation
- Define variables by typing a variable declaration into the input field
- Define variables by using the "Add 2D Shape" and "Add 3D shape" buttons
- Save/Load files containing defined variables using the save/load buttons
- Delete variables using the options button on the respective variable
### Graphics
- Zoom in and out in the graphics windows by scrolling 
- Move around by dragging with the mouse
- Enable fps camera mode to "walk" around in the 3D graphics space like in a typical first person video game
- Hide variables by toggling their "eye" icons 
- Change the display colors of variables by clicking on their black square and selecting a color
- Transform a vector by clicking on it's options and choosing transform, supplying a valid matrix. This will play an animation.

# How to use the input field
Variables are defined by typing <variable_name>=  
Followed by one of the vollowing patterns:
- v = \[1.0,-5.7, ... ] for vector  
- p = (1.0,-5.7, ... ) for point  
- c = 1.0 - 2i for a complex number  
- n = -1.2 or an arithmetic expression* for a real number \[m = cos(32+9)^2.3]  
- A = \[-5,1.3 ... ;2,-4 ... -2.4,5] for matrix \[B = \[1,2,3;4,5,6]   
- f(x) = x^2\*cos(2\*x+1) for function  

\* cos(), sin(), abs() and log() are supported 

In addition to this it is possible to create new variables by inputing predefined variables into one of the following functions:  
*The functions are listed on the following format: \<list parameters represented by their type> to \<list of functions>    

- real scalar to real scalar: cos(x), sin(x), tan(x), log(x), abs(x)
- vector, vector to vector: add(u,v), subtract(u,v), cross(u,v)
- vector, vector to real scalar: dot(u,v), angle(u,v)
- vector, real scalar to vector: scale(v,x)
- vector, matrix to vector: transform(v,A)
- matrix, matrix to matrix: product(A,B)
- matrix, vector to vector: solveLinSys(A,v)
- point, matrix to point: transform(p,A)
- point, point to point: add(p,q), subtract(p,q)
- complex scalar, complex scalar to complex scalar: add(z,w), multiply(z,w)
- complex scalar, real scalar to complex scalar: pow(z,x)
- vector to real scalar: abs(v)
- matrix to matrix: inverse(A)
- function, real scalar, real scalar to real scalar: sum(f,a,b)
- function to function: derivative(f)

 Many of the functions require that the input be of a certain dimention according to mathematical conventions.
 
 # Demonstration
 These are videos showcasing some key features of the app.  
 For some reason the modal window components were not recorded.

# How to run 
The project can be run by simply downloading the file called Linear Algebra Visualizer.jar and opening it, given that java is installed correctly.
